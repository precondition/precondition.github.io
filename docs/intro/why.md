# Why use home row mods?

The reason why would anyone choose to use home row mods are quite simple. A keyboard is no longer used exclusively for text input. It is also used to navigate and operate a computer, launch programs, format text, execute macros, zoom in and out, change input language and so much more which goes beyond simply typing letters. Modifiers play a big role in those functions.

Obviously, typewriters did not have any of those functions. They could only type. The modifier keys that we use so much now were added afterwards, kind of as an afterthought, over the classic typewriter layout which plagues us to this day. It was decided to reduce the width of the spacebar in order to make space for the modifier keys that were needed for the computer age.

As a consequence, you need to do all sorts of finger gymnastics in order to trigger keyboard shortcuts. Not only are you playing Twister with your fingers, you're straining the weakest finger the most in order to hold the necessary modifiers.

This approach to keyboard shortcuts presents some biomechanical issues. These chords may require hyper-extending, hyper-flexing, or splaying the fingers, and may necessitate uncomfortable static muscular loads on top of awkward hand position, especially wrist deviation. All of which can lead to cumulative trauma disorders, as explained by Vern Putz-Anderson in his book titled *"Cumulative trauma disorders: A manual for musculoskeletal diseases of the upper limbs"*, published in 1988.

It is in your best interest to find a solution at the risk of maybe getting RSI and Emacs pinky one day. This is especially important for programmers as most of their keyboard usage isn't actually typing symbols but triggering commands with a plethora of different keyboard shortcuts. Though any power user of any application, not just programmers in their text editor, uses keyboard shortcuts extensively.

Home row mods are about the best solution to this modifier problem. The fact that there are four modifiers, each coming with a left and a right version perfectly matches the eight fingers resting on the home row. We can put a modifier right under each finger and mirror it on both hands.

Isn't it great to have ALL the modifiers at our finger tips? No motion, stretching or strain required. This rapid access to modifier chords is very comfortable and allows to blend the execution of keyboard shortcuts in the typing flow, whereas it previously required a context switch to stop composing text, move the hands to the corner(s) of the keyboard, trigger the desired keyboard shortcut and then find back the homing position to continue touch typing text.

The other benefit of having all the modifiers lined up in a row and each dedicated a specific finger is that you can trigger ANY keyboard shortcut with ease.
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>GUI</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>, also sometimes called [Hyper](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/#s14-hyper),
is an insanity on a standard keyboard but with home row mods, it is trivial: just hold down the four fingers of your hand on the keys you're already resting on. Dedicating a specific finger for each of the four modifier also greatly reduces the amount of repetitive motions your pinky has to execute for all the keyboard shortcuts. Home row mods are also advantageous for the thumbs, for it frees them up for something else like layer switches or [even letters](pressing-e-with-the-thumb). In fact, home row mods and layer thumb keys are a perfect fit. It makes it very easy to chord layers and modifiers together without forcing finger contortions or same finger utilization.

Finally, home row mods (or [variations of the concept] which we'll talk about later in the article) is (a part of) the secret sauce to making all those tiny 30% keyboards[^1] that you've always deemed to be too small to be usable,... actually usable.
